# Download Free Springer books with a Python Script

Springer has released about 500 books* for free in lieu of the pandemic that we're facing at the moment. However, they've linked books in an excel sheet and this can be tedious to download. I have used a [Medium Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/download-all-free-textbooks-from-springer-using-python-bd0b10e0ccc) to create a script that downloads all the books to one folder. 

#### This script can be edited to download other files in batches via links as well. 

## Installation

Download all the files to a folder

#### For Windows Users:
Run the download.bat file via console or double-clicking. 

#### For Non-Windows Users:

Run the following commands in any console of your choice.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python  download_textbooks.py
```

##### *These books are only free until July 2020.
##### **All the books are pdfs and take up about 7.5 GBs of storage.
