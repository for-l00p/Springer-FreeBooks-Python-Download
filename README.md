# Download free Springer books with a Python Script

Springer has released about 500 books for free in lieu of the pandemic that we're facing at the moment. However, they've linked books in an excel sheet and this can be tedious to download. I have used a medium tutorial to create a script that downloads all the books to one folder.

#Instructions 
Simply download all the files to a folder and run the .bat file via console or double clicking. 

If you're on a non windows system, run the following commands in your console:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python  download_textbooks.py
